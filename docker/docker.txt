1. Images
What is it?
A Docker image is a blueprint for creating containers. Think of it like a recipe that tells Docker how to build and run an application, including the app's code, dependencies, and configurations.

Key Features:

Immutable (can’t be changed once created).
Stored in registries (like Docker Hub).
Built using a Dockerfile.
Example:
An image for a Python app might include the Python runtime, your code, and any necessary libraries.

2. Containers
What is it?
A container is a running instance of a Docker image. It's like baking a cake using the recipe (image); the container is the baked cake you can interact with.

Key Features:

Lightweight and portable.
Isolated from the host system.
Can be started, stopped, or deleted without affecting the image.
Example:
Running the Python app from the image creates a container that executes your application.

3. Dockerfile
What is it?
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image.

Key Features:

Defines the base image (e.g., FROM python:3.10).
Adds your application code and dependencies.
Specifies commands to run inside the container.
Example:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use the official Python image
FROM python:3.10

# Copy app files into the image
COPY app/ /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt

# Set the default command
CMD ["python", "/app/main.py"]
This builds an image for a Python application.

4. Volumes
What is it?
A volume is a way to persist data created inside a container so it’s not lost when the container stops or is removed.

Key Features:

Data is stored outside the container's filesystem.
Allows sharing data between containers or between the host and a container.
Ideal for databases, logs, or other stateful applications.
Example:
Mount a volume to save logs:

bash
Copy code
docker run -v /host/logs:/container/logs my-app
5. Networks
What is it?
Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other or with external systems securely.

Key Features:

Containers in the same network can talk to each other.
Different network drivers (e.g., bridge, host, overlay) provide flexibility.
Can isolate groups of containers for security.
Example:
Connect two containers:

bash
Copy code
docker network create my-network
docker run --network=my-network container1
docker run --network=my-network container2

How They Work Together:
Dockerfile: Defines how to create an image.
Image: The blueprint for containers.
Container: A running instance of the image.
Volumes: Persist container data (e.g., databases, logs).
Networks: Enable communication between containers or the outside world.

Workflow Example:
Write a Dockerfile for your app.
Build an image using the Dockerfile (docker build).
Run the image to create a container (docker run).
Attach volumes to save data persistently.
Use networks to link containers and allow communication.


The Docker daemon
The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

The Docker client
The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

Docker registries
A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.

When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, Docker pulls the required images from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, Docker pushes your image to your configured registry.

Docker objects
When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects.


VM machines(VMs)
a VM is an entire operating system with its own kernel, hardware drivers, programs, and applications. Spinning up a VM only to isolate a single application is a lot of overhead.


n this quick hands-on guide, you'll write a Dockerfile that builds a simple Node.js application. If you're not familiar with JavaScript-based applications, don't worry. It isn't necessary for following along with this guide.

I developed a blog application backend using Node.js (Express) with a MongoDB database to manage posts, users, and comments. The API supported CRUD operations, user authentication with JWT, and role-based access control.
